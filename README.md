# Business Card Middleware

This repository is an exact clone of last night's [Express React Homework](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-cheetahs/express-react-middleware) repo. We're going to take your homework from last night and 1) add `morgan` and `body parser`, 2) add a middleware that simply logs `Hello, world!` when you visit the `localhost:3000/people` route (hint: don't forget `next()`), and 3) add a form on the fron end to create a new user and send that to the back end.

*PLEASE NOTE:*

If you use the same repo as last night's homework, you will get a permanent incomplete on that homework. *DO NOT DO THIS.* Please follow these instructions closely:

1. Fork & clone this repo.
2. `cd` into the repo.
3. Run `npm i`.
4. Run `npm i pg sequelize`.
5. Run `node resetDb` and `node seed`.
2. Duplicate & move *the three files you coded* from last night's *completed* homework into this homework's repo. (Make sure you do not delete these files from the other repo, and ensure `index.js`, `App.js`, & `App.css` are in the correct folders.)
3. Finish the homework's 3 steps.
4. Create a new pull request on this repo.
